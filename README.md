🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

2️⃣ Navigate into the Project
cd <repo-name>

3️⃣ Run the Program
python adv_atm.py

🧠 How the Program Works

When the program starts, you will see this menu:

1. Check Balance
2. Withdraw Amount
3. Deposit Amount
4. Change PIN
5. Exit

✔ PIN Handling

The PIN is stored as a string, so leading zeros (e.g., 0612) work perfectly.

Every sensitive operation requires PIN verification.

✔ Menu System

The program runs in a loop until you choose Exit (5).

🛠 Improved Code Structure (Highlights)

✔ Uses string PINs to prevent issues with leading zeros
✔ Global balance and PIN updates
✔ Clean functions
✔ Proper validation for user input
✔ No extra spaces or blank lines during output
